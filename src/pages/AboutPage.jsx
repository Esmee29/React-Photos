    <p className="text-lg leading-8">
      Welcome to my photography portfolio. This site is a showcase of my passion for capturing moments both digitally and on film. 
      I use a mix of digital photography with my trusty Nikon D3300, and film photography using my Canon Sure Shot AF-7. 
      The film photos are shot on a variety of film stocks, each offering its own unique characteristics and feel. 
      I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I enjoyed creating it.
